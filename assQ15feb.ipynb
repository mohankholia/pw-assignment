    "Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques for achieving parallelism in programs, but they have some key differences in terms of how they \n",
    "work and what types of programs they are best suited for. Here are the main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "Concurrency model: The fundamental difference between multiprocessing and multithreading is the concurrency model they use. Multiprocessing runs \n",
    "multiple processes in parallel, each with their own address space and memory, whereas multithreading runs multiple threads within the same process, \n",
    "all sharing the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU usage: Multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks, where the program spends a lot of time performing calculations or other CPU-intensive\n",
    "operations. Because each process has its own memory space, multiprocessing can make use of multiple CPUs or cores to execute tasks in parallel, \n",
    "allowing for improved performance. Multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks, where the program spends a lot of time waiting for I/O \n",
    "operations to complete (such as reading from a file or network socket). Because all threads share the same memory, multithreading can improve \n",
    "performance by allowing the program to do other work while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Multiprocessing has higher overhead than multithreading because each process needs its own memory space and resources, which can slow down\n",
    "the creation of new processes. Multithreading has lower overhead because threads share the same memory and resources, and creating new threads is\n",
    "generally faster than creating new processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multiprocessing can achieve true parallelism, with each process running on a separate CPU or core, whereas multithreading can only \n",
    "achieve concurrent execution, with threads taking turns executing on a single CPU or core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between multiprocessing and multithreading depends on the type of program being developed and the specific requirements of \n",
    "\n",
    "the application. If the program is primarily CPU-bound, multiprocessing is generally the better choice, whereas if the program is primarily I/O-bound,\n",
    "multithreading is often a better fit.\"\"\""
