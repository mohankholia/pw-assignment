    "ans1=\"ans: An Exception inPython is an event that occurs during the execution of a program which disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions are raised when a program encounters a runtime error, such as division by zero or trying to access an undefined variable.The difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors:Syntax errors are a type of error that occur when the Python interpreter encounters a line of code that does not conform to thesyntax rules of the language. These errors are detected before the program is executed and usually occur because of typos or mistakes inthe code.Exceptions, on the other hand, are errors that occur at runtime, after the program has started executing. They are usually caused by unexpected conditions or inputs, such as dividing by zero or trying to access an element in a list that doesn't exist.Both Syntax errors and Exceptions are types of errors in Python, but they occur at different stages of the program's execution and arehandled differently.\"\n",
